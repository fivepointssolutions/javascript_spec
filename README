=JavaScript spec testing plugin

Based heavily on the javascript_test plugin in the Rails Subversion repository,
this plugin provides the JSSpec testing framework in a way that integrates
with Rails applications.

==Usage

Use the provided generator to build a skeleton for your JavaScript spec.
The built-in rake task can then be used to automatically run the specs
in various installed browsers (supported are Firefox on IE/Mac/Linux, 
Safari on Mac, Konqueror on Linux).

Note that due to the built-in webrick, you don't have to change anything
about your app, just add specs. :)

==Example

Generate a JavaScript spec skeleton for your public/javascripts/foo.js file:

  script/generate javascript_spec foo

Run the javascript spects and see the automagically controlled browsers in
action:

  rake spec:javascripts
  
You have to manually close the browser window(s) afterwards.

You can also run the spec manually, by symlinking the assets directory.
In your Rails application root, run:

  ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/javascript_spec/assets/ spec/javascript/assets
  
You then can just open the individual .html spec files in your browser.

All in all, JSSpec.js is closely modeled on RSpec. For more information about
writing Javascript specs, see:

==Credits

The credit for this plugin really goes to Thomas Fuchs who authord the
original javascript_test plugin. Also, Jon Tirsen authored the automated 
browser remote control-niceties.
